# **WEM**

Basic C/C++ header only math library.
## **FEATURES** <br/>

Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix4x4, Bezier curves and few macros and RNG functions.
## **WEM_INTR** <br/>

Implementation using intrinsic functions.<br/>
All vectors have 4 elements, making them less memory efficient than WEM vectors<br/>
and are somewhat less intuative to use, because functions take pointers.

Vector2, Vector3, Vector4
